## Welcome to PrimeHub CE v3 installation scenario.

The purpose of this scenario is to let audience to feel how easy the brand new PrimeHub CE v3 installation could be.

In this scenario, we will walk you through the installation steps referring to [PrimeHub CE repo](https://github.com/InfuseAI/primehub/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

+ If your Katacoda environment times out or has connection problems during the scenario, just refresh the page to restart the scenario.
+ After you launch a notebook in PrimeHub, please try using PrimeHub CE with your own real-life scenario for some hands-on experience.
