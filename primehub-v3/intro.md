## Welcome to PrimeHub CE v3 installation scenario.

The purpose of this scenario is to walk audience through PrimeHub CE v3.c easy installation on 2-Node Kubernetes cluster.

+ Step 1 to step 2: Set up an existing 2-Node Kubernetes cluster to become PrimeHub-ready cluster.
+ Step 3: Install PrimeHub CE.
+ Step 4: Launch a Jupyter Notebook in PrimeHub.

Grab a cup of coffee and start the scenario.

▶️ Visit [PrimeHub CE GitHub repo](https://github.com/InfuseAI/primehub) and [PrimeHub Documentation](https://docs.primehub.io/)for the detail.

**Tips**: Simply click the code-blocks in each step to execute the code without need to type anything.

## Notice

+ The behaviour of PrimeHub can be affected by an unstable/resource-shortage Katacoda environment.
+ If your Katacoda environment times out or has connection problems during the scenario, just refresh the page to restart the scenario.
+ After you launch a notebook in PrimeHub, please try using PrimeHub CE with your own real-life scenario for some hands-on experience.
